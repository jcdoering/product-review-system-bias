## 1. Overview/General Info
This project is part of a doctoral (Ph.D.) research at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada by Jeffrey Doering (Ph.D. Candidate). The purpose of this simulation is to evaluate the magnitude and direction of cumulative influence from individual online consumer reviews across the entire system of a product reviews for a product category. 

The assumptions underlying this simulation are:  

A) Individual online product reviews bias subsequent purchase decisions by consumers  
B) Comulative online product reviews bias subsequent purchase decisions by consumers
C) 

Please reach out to the author of this project for citations and background research related to the simulation assumptions.

## 2. Technologies and Dependencies
This project utilizes Python 3.9.13 (Aug '22; iPython 7.31.1)  

The following packages are required for the code to run:


## 3. Instructions  
The run_sim.py file is the file in which you will need to configure simulation variables (if desired variable settings are different than default) and execute to run the primary simulation.
